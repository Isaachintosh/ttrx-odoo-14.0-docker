# For security reasons, if odoo use a reverse proxy it's important for Odoo to make sure the proxy_mode parameter is set to True. 
# The reason for this is that, when Nginx acts as a proxy, 
# all request will appear to come from the server itself instead of the remote IP address. 
# Setting the X-Forwarded-For header in the proxy and enabling proxy_mode solves that.

# Unaccent is a text search dictionary that removes accents (diacritic signs) from lexemes.
